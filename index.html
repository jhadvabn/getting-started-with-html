<p>In this introductory course we will learn how to program using <em>HTML.</em>
<br>HTML stands for <b><em>H</em></b>yper<b><em>T</em></b>ext <b><em>M</em></b>arkup <b>L<em></em></b>anguage.  HTML uses tags and attributes to define how the content is displayed. 
<br>Some of the tags that we learned are:</p>
<ul>
<li>b = bold</li>
<li>br = break</li>
<li>p = paragraph</li>
<li>img = image</li>
<li>a = anchor</li>
<br>
FYI - the above needs the less than and greater than signs around them but I'm not sure how to display them as text.
<br>
<p><b>Inline vs. Block Tags</b>
  <br>Tags are either <em>inline</em>or <em>block</em>.  Block tags such a "P" for paragraph have width and height
  <br>while inline tags do not.
  </p>
  <p><b>Attributes</b>
    <br>Tags can also include an attribute which give the developer more control over what a webpage can do.
    <br>For example the anchor tag (a) can include an 'href' attribute which references a URL.
    <br>
    <br>i.e. <a href="www.cnn.com">CNN</a>
    <br>'img src' is another attribute for referencing an image within a webpage.
